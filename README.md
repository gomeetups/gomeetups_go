# GoMeetups!

[GoMeetups!](http://gomeetups.com) is a toy project to learn / teach different languages, including [Go](https://golang.org/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) .

This repo contains the api server implementation in go. For the moment, it uses [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) as http framework although, please be sure that you have checked the [standard library](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) to understand what's happening under the hood and as well as other alternatives like [chi](https://github.com/pressly/chi) and [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux).

It doesn't implemented yet but PostgreSQL will be used as a persistent store.


# Why?

Why not? Isn't it nice to play around, learn something new and share?
